# here using for loop with range non-logically like...
i = range(40,30,2)
for j in i:
    print(j)

# It will not supported in python.so it will not display any elements,It will displays empty.

# that's while we need to write -2 value in range dicreasing...Its works like...

z = range(40,10,-2)
for a in z:
    print(a)
