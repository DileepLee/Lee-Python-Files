a = {}
print(a)
print(type(a))
print(len(a))

# Whenever we run this code it will gives the Type is Dict type..Because dictionary object also created using {}.
# When the set Object will take {} with set type means... Whenever we give the Values inside the curly brakets,it will take and gives the object type is Set...
# Like This...

x = {10,20,30,40,50}
print(x)
print(type(x))
print(len(x))

# And We can Use Directly set() for converting the set type...like this

y = set()
print(y)
print(type(y))
print(len(y))

# This is the to get the type of set object...
